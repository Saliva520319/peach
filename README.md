Peaches are sweet and awesome with a strong core, and so is **Peach** which is built on top of the beloved [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) and [Flask-restful](https://github.com/flask-restful/flask-restful/) with a touch of magic to make building apis less tedious, letting you focus on the business logic rather than on the databse abstractions, endpoint routing and configurations, blueprint definitions or request parrsing. It also comes with some nice out of the box funtionalities such as automagic wiring between resource, models, database and model filtering. If you like some of Django's magic, but love flask and its minimalistic philosophy, then you'll love **Peach**.

Tired of reading docs? Okay, here's a full example of a very simple api from scratch

```python
